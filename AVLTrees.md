## Notes

### **Motivation Behind Balanced Binary Search Trees (AVL Trees)**
   - Introduction to the topic: Upcoming discussions on balanced binary search trees, specifically AVL trees.
   - Background on data structures: Arrays, linked lists, and binary search trees covered so far.
   - Comparison of linked lists and arrays: Advantages and disadvantages in terms of manipulation at the beginning (linked lists) and end (arrays).
   - Limitation of arrays and linked lists: Necessity of linear search for arbitrary item search.
   - Advantage of binary search trees: Logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for searching due to their structured nature.
   - Binary search tree characteristics: Left child smaller than the parent, right child larger.
   - Binary search trees' easy logic: Storing items in a sorted order for efficient binary search.
   - Disadvantages of binary search trees: Average case works well, but worst-case degenerates to linked list with linear time complexities.
   - Example of worst-case scenario: Inserting items in a sequential manner leading to a linked list structure.
   - Conclusion on binary search trees: Possibility of being balanced or imbalanced, need for balancing to achieve logarithmic complexity.
   - Introduction of the height parameter in AVL trees: Ensuring minimal tree height for balanced structures.
   - Overview of AVL trees: Focus on maintaining tree balance to optimize performance.

### **Introduction to AVL Trees**
   - Nature of AVL trees: Balanced binary search trees ensuring logarithmic time complexity.
   - Invention and naming: Developed in 1962 by two Russian scientists, named after their initials (AVL).
   - Similarity to binary search trees: Follows the same basic structure but maintains balance.
   - Comparison with Red-Black Trees: AVL trees are more rigidly balanced, leading to faster operations but requiring more balancing work.
   - Real-world applications: Usage in operating systems, e.g., Windows favoring AVL trees and Linux preferring Red-Black Trees.
   - The balance in AVL Trees: Continuous checking and restructuring for balance after each insertion or deletion.
   - AVL tree operations: Similar to binary search trees, but with additional balance checking and rotations.
   - Handling imbalances: Use of rotations to transform an imbalanced tree into a balanced one.
   - Trade-offs in tree structures: Between construction speed and operational efficiency, differing in AVL and Red-Black Trees.
   - The balancing act: Ensuring logarithmic time complexity for operations in the worst-case scenarios.

### **AVL Trees - Height Parameter**
   - Understanding AVL tree height: Defined as the number of edges on the longest downward path from the root to a leaf.
   - Height parameter for nodes: Calculated as the longest path from a node to a leaf.
   - Recursive calculation of height: Based on the height of left and right children, plus one.
   - Special case for null nodes: Assigned a height of -1, making leaf nodes have a height of 0.
   - Use of height parameter: Determining if a tree is balanced by comparing left and right subtree heights.
   - Balanced vs. Imbalanced Trees: Balanced trees have logarithmic time complexities, imbalanced ones can degrade to linear.
   - Imbalance indication: A significant difference in height parameters between left and right subtrees.
   - Ensuring balance in AVL Trees: Minimizing differences between subtree height parameters.

### **AVL Trees - Rotations**
   - Purpose of rotations: To maintain balance in AVL trees and ensure consistent performance.
   - Types of rotations: Left and right rotations, determined by the balance factor of nodes.
   - Right-heavy and left-heavy trees: Indicated by negative and positive balance factors, respectively.
   - Rotation procedures: Detailed explanation of how left and right rotations are performed.
   - Preservation of binary search tree properties: Ensuring parent-child relationships and inorder traversal order remain consistent post-rotation.
   - Different rotation scenarios: Handling left-heavy, right-heavy, left-right, and right-left situations with appropriate rotations.
   - Importance of rotation in AVL Trees: Maintaining balance to guarantee logarithmic running time complexity.
   - Consideration of further imbalances: Need to check for additional imbalances post-rotation.

### **AVL Tree Implementation**
   - Implementation stages: Covering node creation, tree structure, insertion, removal, height calculation, violation handling, and rotations.
   - Node class: Storing data, left and right children, parent node, and height parameter.
   - AVL tree class: Managing the root node and providing insert and remove operations.
   - Insertion process: Adding nodes while maintaining tree balance, updating height parameters.
   - Removal process: Deleting nodes with considerations for tree balance, handling various cases like leaf and single-child nodes.
   - Height calculation: Recursive determination of node height based on children's height.
