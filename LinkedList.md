### Topic: Linked List Implementation

**1. In implementing a linked list, what does each node typically contain?**
   - A) Data and a reference to the previous node.
   - B) Only the data it stores.
   - C) Data and a reference to the next node.

**2. When initializing a linked list, what is the initial value of the head node?**
   - A) Points to the first element.
   - B)Points to null.
   - C) Points to the last element.

**3. What is a key consideration when adding a node at the end of a linked list?**
   - A) Updating the head node.
   - B) Traversing the entire list to find the end.
   - C) Allocating contiguous memory for the new node.

**4. In a singly linked list, how can you remove a node (not the first one) efficiently?**
   - A) By directly accessing the node and deleting it.
   - B) By updating the pointer of the previous node.
