## Summarries

## 1. What are stacks?

- **Stack Abstract Data Type**: A data type with undefined implementation, similar to a deck of cards where access is limited to the top item only. 
- **Implementation Methods**: Stacks can be implemented using linked lists or arrays.
- **LIFO Structure**: Stacks operate on a Last In, First Out principle.
- **Basic Operations**: Include push (insert item), pop (remove last item), and peek (return value of top item without removing it).
- **Programming Language Usage**: Stacks are essential in modern programming languages for storing function calls and local variables.
- **Stack Frames in OS**: Operating systems use stack frames to execute basic operations.

## 2. Stacks in memory management (stacks and heaps)

- **Differences between Stack and Heap Memory**: Stack memory is smaller, faster, and can't become fragmented, while heap memory is larger, slower, and can become fragmented.
- **Memory Loading Process**: When an application is run, the machine level binary code is loaded into memory.
- **Stack Memory Attributes**: Stores local variables and method calls, can result in stack overflow error if too many stack frames are added.
- **Heap Memory Attributes**: Used for dynamic memory allocation, can result in heap memory overflow if too many objects are allocated.

## 3. Stack memory visualization

- **Function Calls and Local Variables**: Stored on the stack memory, allowing the programming language to know where to return after a function is executed.
- **Class Variables and Instance Variables**: Stored on the heap memory, with a reference stored on the stack memory.
- **Stack Memory and Heap Memory**: Stack memory stores function calls, parameters and local variables, while heap memory stores objects and their related class variables.
- **Garbage Collection**: Removes unused objects from the heap memory.

## 4. Stack implementation

- **Stack Class Creation**: A stack is created as a one-dimensional array within a Python class.
- **Push Method**: Inserts an item into the stack.
- **Pop Method**: Removes the last item inserted into the stack.
- **Peek Method**: Returns the value of the top item without removing it.
- **Stack Size Method**: Returns the number of items in the stack.

## 5. Practical (real-world) applications of stacks

- **Browser Back Button**: Uses a stack to store recently visited URLs, allowing users to return to previously visited pages.
- **Undo Operation in Applications**: Uses a stack to store states, allowing users to return to previous states.
- **Stack Memory in Operating Systems**: Stores function calls and local variables, allowing the operating system to know where to return after a function is executed.
